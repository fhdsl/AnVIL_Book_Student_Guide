AnVIL is NHGRI’s Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space. It provides a platform for performing genomic data analysis on the cloud. 1.2 Does AnVIL Cost Money? Through AnVIL, you pay for computing resources as you use them. As a student, your instructor will have set up a billing account to cover your class costs. 1.3 Where Can I Get Help? Please visit our community support forum at help.anvilproject.org with any questions (or suggestions!) you may have. You can also visit the Getting Started Guide and anvilproject.org/learn for additional resources. "],["create-a-terra-account.html", "Chapter 2 Create a Terra account 2.1 Create a Google Account 2.2 Sign in to Terra", " Chapter 2 Create a Terra account AnVIL uses Terra to run analyses. Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll need a (free) Google account in order to use AnVIL. 2.1 Create a Google Account If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 2.2 Sign in to Terra You need to sign into Terra with your Google account to allow your instructor to add you to projects and/or Workspaces associated with your specific class. This is the only way you can launch applications and perform computations on AnVIL. Launch Terra and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. Collect Accounts: It is very important that you share the Google account you used above with with your instructor! Otherwise, the instructor cannot add you to billing projects or Workspaces, and you will be unable to proceed with your assignments. You can always access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page. "],["workspace.html", "Chapter 3 Cloning a workspace", " Chapter 3 Cloning a workspace In the next few steps, you will walk through how to get started on the AnVIL platform. AnVIL is centered around different “Workspaces”. Each Workspace functions almost like a mini code laboratory - it is a place where data can be examined, stored, and analyzed. The first thing we want to do is to copy or “clone” a Workspace to create a space for you to experiment. Use a web browser to go to the AnVIL website. In the browser type: anvil.terra.bio Tip At this point, it might make things easier to open up a new window in your browser and split your screen. That way, you can follow along with this guide on one side and execute the steps on the other. After logging in, click “View Workspaces”. Select the “Public” tab. In the top search bar type the activity workspace “SARS-CoV-2-Genome”. You can also go directly to the following link: https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/gdscn-exercises/SARS-CoV-2-Genome. Clone the workspace by clicking the teardrop button (). And selecting “Clone”. In the first box, give your Workspace clone a name by adding an underscore (“_”) and your name. For example, “SARS-CoV-2-Genome_Ava_Hoffman”. Next, select the Billing project provided by your instructor. Leave the bottom two boxes as-is and click “CLONE WORKSPACE”. "],["working-in-galaxy.html", "Chapter 4 Working in Galaxy 4.1 Starting Galaxy 4.2 Navigating Galaxy 4.3 Deleting Galaxy environment", " Chapter 4 Working in Galaxy Galaxy is a great tool for performing bioinformatics analysis without having to update software or worry too much about coding. In order to use Galaxy, we need to create a cloud environment. This is like quickly renting a few computers from Google as the engine to power our Galaxy analysis. 4.1 Starting Galaxy In your new Workspace, click on the “NOTEBOOKS” tab. Next, click on “Create a Cloud Environment for Galaxy”. You should see a popup window on the right side of the screen. Click on “NEXT” and “CREATE” to keep all settings as-is. This will take 8-10 minutes. When it is done, click “LAUNCH GALAXY”. You can also follow along with the first ~2 minutes of this video to start Galaxy on AnVIL. 4.2 Navigating Galaxy Notice the three main sections. Tools - These are all of the bioinformatics tool packages available for you to use. The Main Dashboard - This contains flash messages and posts when you first open Galaxy, but when we are using data this is the main interface area. History - When you start a project you will be able to see all of the documents in the project in the history. Now be aware, this can become very busy. Also the naming that Galaxy uses is not very intuitive, so you must make sure that you label your files with something that makes sense to you. On the welcome page, there are links to tutorials. You may try these out on your own. If you want to try a new analysis this is a good place to start. 4.3 Deleting Galaxy environment Once you are done with your activity, you’ll need to shut down your Galaxy cloud environment. This frees up the cloud resources for others and minimizes computing cost. The following steps will delete your work, so make sure you are completely finished at this point. Otherwise, you will have to repeat your work from the previous steps. Return to AnVIL, and find the Galaxy logo that shows your cloud environment is running. Click on this logo: Next, click on “DELETE ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS”: Finally, select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”. Make sure you are done with the activity and then click “DELETE”. "],["rstudio.html", "Chapter 5 Working in RStudio 5.1 Launch RStudio Cloud Environment 5.2 Tour RStudio 5.3 Pause RStudio 5.4 Delete RStudio Cloud Environment 5.5 Video Guide", " Chapter 5 Working in RStudio Once you have created a Workspace, you can create an RStudio cloud environment. This will allow you to interface with data and perform genomics-based analyses with add on packages from the Bioconductor community. 5.1 Launch RStudio Cloud Environment Click on the name of the Workspace you just created. You should be routed to a link that looks like: https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/&lt;billing-project&gt;/&lt;workspace-name&gt;. On the top right, Click the gear icon to access your Cloud Environment options. You will see a list of costs because it costs a small amount of money to use cloud computing. Click “CUSTOMIZE”. Click on the first drop down menu to see what other software configurations are available. Scroll down and select RStudio from the Community-Maintained RStudio Environments section. NOTE: AnVIL is very versatile and can scale up to use very powerful cloud computers. It’s very important that you select the cloud computing environment described here to avoid runaway costs. Leave everything else as-is. To create your RStudio Cloud Environment, click on the “CREATE” button. Your Cloud Environment will be available in a few minutes after the cloud resources are provisioned and your software starts up. The upper right corner displays the status and should say “Creating” while resources are being provisioned. After a few minutes, you will see the status change to “Running”. Click on the “R” icon to launch RStudio. You should now see the RStudio interface with information about the version printed to the console. 5.2 Tour RStudio Next, we will be using RStudio and the package Glimma to create interactive plots. See this vignette for more information. The Bioconductor team has created a very useful package to programmatically interact with Terra and Google Cloud. Install the AnVIL package. It will make some steps easier as we go along. BiocManager::install(&quot;AnVIL&quot;) You can now quickly install precompiled binaries using the AnVIL package’s install() function. We will use it to install the Glimma package and the airway package. The airway package contains a SummarizedExperiment data class. This data describes an RNA-Seq experiment on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated with dexamethasone. {Note: for some of the packages, you will have to install packaged from the CRAN repository, using the install.packages() function. The examples will show you which install method to use.} ```r AnVIL::install(c(&quot;Glimma&quot;, &quot;airway&quot;)) ``` &lt;img src=&quot;04-RStudio_files/figure-html//1BLTCaogA04bbeSD1tR1Wt-mVceQA6FHXa8FmFzIARrg_g11f12bc99af_0_56.png&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted.&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the RStudio environment interface. Code has been typed in the console and is highlighted.&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt; Load the example data. library(airway) data(airway) The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot is frequently used to explore differences in samples. When this data is MDS transformed, the first two dimensions explain the greatest variance between samples, and the amount of variance decreases monotonically with increasing dimension. The following code will launch a new window where you can interact with the MDS plot. Glimma::glimmaMDS(assay(airway), group = colData(airway)$dex) Change the colour_by setting to “groups” so you can easily distinguish between groups. In this data, the “group” is the treatment. You can download the interactive html file by clicking on “Save As”. You can also download plots and other files created directly in RStudio. To download the following plot, click on “Export” and save in your preferred format to the default directory. This saves the file in your cloud environment. limma::plotMDS(airway) You should see the plot in the “Files” pane. Select this file and click “More” &gt; “Export” Select “Download” to save the file to your local machine. 5.3 Pause RStudio The upper right corner reminds you that you are accruing cloud computing costs. You should minimize charges when you are not performing an analysis. You can do this by clicking on “Stop cloud environment”. This will release the CPU and memory resources for other people to use. Note that your work will be saved in the environment and continue to accrue a very small cost. Your instructor can delete these environments to stop costs accruing, so it’s a good idea to save code or output somewhere else, such as GitHub or your local machine. 5.4 Delete RStudio Cloud Environment Stopping your cloud environment only pauses your work. When you are ready to delete the cloud environment, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to “Update cloud environment”. Click on “Delete Environment Options”. If you are certain that you do not need the data and configuration on your disk, you should select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”. Select “DELETE”. 5.5 Video Guide In addition to the steps above, you can review this video guide on how to launch RStudio on AnVIL.
